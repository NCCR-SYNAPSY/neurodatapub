BIDS standard
*******************************************

A dataset published with `NeuroDataPub` HAS TO ADOPT the :abbr:`BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)` standard for data organization and is developed following the BIDS App standard. This means that `NeuroDataPub` handles only datasets formatted following the BIDS standard (See :ref:`cmdusage` for more details).

For more information about BIDS, please consult the `BIDS Website <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_ and the `Online BIDS Specifications <https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_. `HeuDiConv <https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv>`_ can assist you in converting DICOM brain imaging data to BIDS. A nice tutorial can be found @ `BIDS Tutorial Series: HeuDiConv Walkthrough <http://reproducibility.stanford.edu/bids-tutorial-series-part-2a/>`_ .

.. important:: 
    Before using `NeuroDataPub`, we highly recommend you to validate your BIDS structured dataset with the free, online `BIDS Validator <http://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/>`_.
